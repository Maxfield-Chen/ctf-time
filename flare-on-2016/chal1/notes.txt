STATIC ANALYSIS:
Interesting Strings
  Days and Months, alphabet
  Language codes?
  enter_password
  Correct
Notable Functions:
  4014ae: Password collection
  401260: Takes a var(94) which is then passed to winfunc
  402c30: Winfunc
    -args: 
Win at 0x4014ae
Avoid at 0x4014c7
Start at 0x401479

Read and then sub 2

In the only readable start code they call int 21h which is the DOS function dispatcher?
  -Moves 9 into ah(eax)
    -This writes a string to stdout terminated with '$'
Appears to be packed. Going to try to dump from memory.
DYNAMIC ANALYSIS:
  -First thing Immunity breaks on is 0x3C170D
  -Quickly calls getSystemTimeAsFileTime, GetCurrentThreadId, GetCurrentProcessId, QueryPerformanceCounter
    -This sounds like some unfortunate anti-debug things.
      -Common mistake, actually used to calculate canary?
      -http://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/6879/defeat-queryperformancecounter-as-anti-debugging-trick
  -ASLR is on, break on function call to password func (0x401479 in r2).

Twitter tip says to check out DES or base64. Interesting.
Might be base64 modified alphabet?
  -Hardcoded string: x2dtJEOmyjacxDemx2eczT5cVS9fVUGvWTuZWjuexjRqy24rV29q, len=52
    -Maybe password, too long to be alphabet
  -ZYXABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWzyxabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw012345679?/
