Static Analysis:
  -We have a document which doesn't open and an exe which was presumably used to "encrypt" the document.
  -Looking at functions of DL shows lots of crypto functionality
lots and lots and lots of encrypted strings

  -Briefcase string?

Start at: 0x4019a0, SHELL32.dll_SHGetFolderPathW
0x401940: Encryption function?
  -args(5): local_4h, local_10h, local_8h

Dynamic Analysis:
  -Lots of variables set to constants at start of 0x4019a0, could be useful for encryption function magic numbers / IV.
  -Drops a file called briefcase to the desktop
    -Called with open_existing so we need to make this file.
In 0x401040, GetVolumeInformationA result(Top Of Stack) is compared to 0x7DAB1D35
  -If you don't pass the check, eax is set to 0, which gives you "im out of my element."
    -Just patch that function...so we always pass the check and return 0x7dab1d35 in eax.
    -Need to install Ida Fentanyl, so I can do proper patches
Encryption Function(0x401940):
  -Called with 0x4030000, 0x208600, 0xa12ff70, 0x25
  -0x4030000: "AuP{PnTqAtAuZqGiPiG"
  -0x25: Heapsize (37)
  -Takes each byte of the allocated heap space sets it equal to "AuP{PnTqAtAuZqGiPiG" xor 0x7dab1d35 
  -Find 

The output of that encryption function is hashed(SHA) with CryptCreateHash, CryptHashData and then used as the base data for CryptDeriveKey which creates a deterministic symettric key.
